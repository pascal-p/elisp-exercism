## Running the tests

Tests can be run several ways:

1. Interactively and individually, with `M-x ert RET test-name RET`
2. Interactively and all at once, with `M-x ert RET t RET`
3. From the terminal, in batch mode, with `emacs -batch -l ert -l sieve-test.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit`
4. Other options can be found in the docs, `C-h i m ert RET`

## Need to get help?

To get help if you're having trouble, you can use one of the following resources:

- [The Emacs Wiki](http://emacswiki.org/) is invaluable. Spend lots of time here.
- [The Emacs Editor](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html) is the official manual for GNU Emacs.
- IRC - there are [freenode](https://freenode.net/) channels for `#emacs`, `#prelude`, and many Emacs
  packages, and many helpful folks around. And with emacs, IRC is as close as
  `M-x erc`.
- [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/elisp) can be used to search for your problem and see if it has been answered already. You can also ask and answer questions.
